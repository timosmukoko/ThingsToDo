    <h1 align="center">Lagos - Algarve - Portugal</h1>
    <h2 align="center">Welcome to Lagos Uncovered! Your Lagos holiday guide!</h2>
	
    <p>Lagos Uncovered! brings you everything you need to know about   holidays in Lagos, Portugal. Useful Algarve information, beaches,   accommodation, map, restaurants,
	bars, things to do and in fact, all   things <em>Lagos Uncovered!</em></p>
    <p align="center"><img src="Images/lagos-portugal-map.jpg" width="500" height="248"  alt="Map of the Algarve (south Portugal) showing Lagos in the western region"/></p>

    <p><img src="images/lagos_home1.jpg" alt="Lagos bay and Ponta da Bandeira" align="right" height="208" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="250">
	Lagos   is a fantastic town in the western Algarve that can certainly be   enjoyed by all age groups. It is full of historical interest with it's 
	origins dating as far back as 2000 years BC when it was known as   Lacobriga. Lagos has always had a seafaring connection, originally   visited by 
	Phoenicians and Carthaginians and then, during the 15th   century, was the base for the 'voyages of the Discoveries' instigated by   Henry the Navigator 
	when trade between Africa and Portugal brought a   great deal of wealth into the town.</p>
    <p>The older part of Lagos is still circled by the city walls that were   constructed during the 16th century when it was the residence of the 
	governors of the Algarve and the fort, Ponta da Bandeira, by Batata   beach is part of the 17th century fortifications that were added to   protect the town.
	Behind it (on the opposite side of the road) is the   Porta de São Gonçalo (St.Gonçalo&rsquo;s gate) with a watchtower on either   side and just to the right 
	of this is the Governors' Castle (of Arab   construction).</p>
    <p><img src="images/lagos-domhenrique.jpg" alt="Dom Henrique square in Lagos" align="left" height="208" width="250">The   square next to the Governors' castle
	is the Praça Infante Dom Henrique   with a statue of Prince Henry looking out to sea. To the left of the   square at the back is Igreja da Santa Maria. The
	facade of this church   is 15/16th century but it was rebuilt in the 18/19th centuries.</p>
    <p>Walk along the cobbled street at the back of the square just past   Santa Maria church and you will come to the famous Lagos 'golden church'   of St.
	Anthony which was rebuilt in 1769 - entrance to this church is   through the museum at the side and both the museum and the church are   well worth visiting.
	On the opposite side to the churches is the 'Slave   Market' from the 15th century, where slaves brought back from the   discovery voyages were sold. There is 
	another church, St. Sebastian,   dating from 14th to 16th century, which is on a hill just behind the   fish market with fantastic views over Lagos bay.</p>
    <p><img src="images/lagos_home3.jpg" alt="Praça de Gil Eanes, Lagos town centre" align="right" height="208" width="250">Lagos   is certainly full of history,
	but it is also a vibrant town with lots   going on - the next square along, in the middle of town, is Praça de Gil   Eanes and this is often the setting for 
	evening entertainment   throughout the year - a comical unicyclist, live music or a medieval   fair are just some of the events we have enjoyed. If Portugal 
	are   playing football, or there is a major competition on, the cafes will   have the big screens up in the square and everyone joins in the   excitement 
	(very good naturedly as well).</p>
    <p>There are several streets leading off Praça de Gil Eanes, with   restaurants to suit all tastes! The centre of Lagos really isn't very   big, but it can 
	be a bit confusing! There are so many little streets   criss-crossing that it is quite easy to loose your bearings, but to be   honest, as long as you head 
	down hill you are sure to get back to the   centre! There are loads of bars that stay open until the early hours and   in the summer time the centre of town
	is alive with people of all ages   enjoying themselves. There are always touts from the different bars   offering a free drink or 'shot' at 'their' bar, 
	but it can be a useful   way to find them as they are often tucked away down one of the many   little side streets.</p>
    <p><img src="images/lagos_home4.jpg" alt="Lagos marina" align="left" height="208" width="250">To   explore a little further, carry on along the Avenida dos
	Descobrimentos   (avenue of the Discoveries) which runs along the water front and you   will come to the very modern, Lagos Marina. There is a footbridge over 
	the Bensafrim river to the marina which, on one of Lagos' windy days,   can be a very blowy walk, but you do get a lovely view of the town and   the 'boats' in 
	the marina!</p>
    <p>The 450+ berth marina, which has both the Euromarina Anchor Award and   the Blue Flag award, has a variety of shops, bars and restaurants to   enjoy,
	all with a great view of the 'boats'! <br>
      There is normally some music in the bars and if you want to watch your   favourite football team, they screen the big matches and various sports   events!</p>
    <p>Lagos train station is behind the marina and the road that runs past   the station takes you to the beginning of Meia Praia beach - a 4km   stretch of
	golden sand with several beach bars along it's length (some   of which stay open all year round).<br>
      On the right hand side, just over the marina bridge, is the dock area   for the fishing boats and several places selling the freshly caught fish  
	  (some also have small restaurants upstairs).</p>
    <p><img src="images/lagos_home5.jpg" alt="View from Ponta da Piedade, Lagos" align="right" height="208" width="250">If   you ask for directions
	in Lagos you will almost certainly be directed   by way of the various roundabouts! The first one at the entrance to   Lagos is very obviously 
	the 'Ship' roundabout (the tourist office is   nearby). The 'Ball' roundabout (a very large black ball) is at the top   of the hill at the far
	end of the Avenida dos Descobrimentos, past the   fire station - on the way to Dona Ana, Ponta da Piedade and Porto de   Mos. The third 'landmark' 
	is 'The Chairs' (7 large perspex chairs that   light up at night!), this is up the hill past the Lidl supermarket at   the opposite side of town to the 'Ball'.</p>
    <p>While we are on the subject of supermarkets - Lagos is very well provided for - check our Useful Information for location and opening hours of the 
	main supermarkets. There are lots   of mini-mercados dotted around and they stock a very wide range of   products, fresh breads, meats, milk etc, just 
	the same as the large   supermarkets, and for the vegetarians - a lot now stock some soya and   tofu products.</p>
    <p><img src="images/lagos_home6.jpg" alt="Lagos Saturday market" align="left" height="208" width="250">There   is a local Lagos market on Saturday mornings 
	in a building near the bus   station (opposite the marina footbridge) - it has all the fresh fruits   and vegetables, olives, honey, figs, almonds and much
	more. It's quite a   small market, but very popular and cheap! If you decide to go, try and   get there early and take 'small change' with you 
	(euros and 50 cents   should do!).</p>
    <p>There is also a daily market in the recently renovated fish market   nearer to town - all the fresh fish and seafood is downstairs and   
	upstairs are market stalls full of fruit, vegetables, dried fruits and   preserves and also fresh bread. The top floor has a restaurant and a 
	fantastic view across Lagos bay.</p>
    <p>Lagos has some stunning views, it has to be said! From the Ponte da   Piedade (in front of the lighthouse) you get a fantastic view of the  
	sweeping sands of Lagos bay with the Monchique hills as a backdrop, and   you can see all the way to Sagres to the west and past Albufeira to the   east.</p>
